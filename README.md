Hurray! i learned the basics of CSS including things like different ways to include CSS in your project, CSS Selectors, Pseudoselectors, input selectors and so on. I also learned about the SASS, which is syntatically awesome stylesheet, basically add a bit of programming type syntax to your CSS, making it easier to manage your project using variables, mixins (functions basically), loops and conditions and so on. It was fun, one step closer to becoming a full stack web developer!
